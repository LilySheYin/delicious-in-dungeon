# Dungeon Meshi
A wholesome homebrewed campaign setting based on the manga by Ryōko Kui.
Explore the myth and mystery of the phenomenon we know as dungeons, unravel the mechanics of magic, and forge bonds that can only be forged between people who have seen hell and decided to use the flames to cook a meal together.

## About the Game
Dungeon Meshi is based on a manga, and translates to “Delicious in Dungeon”… DinD.

Often ignored or treated as a chore in most campaigns, food will instead be a core mechanic in this game. Depending on how successful you are at in-game meal prep, food will not only stave off the effects of Exhaustion, but can even heal or buff (or debuff, depending on circumstances…) your characters. 

Also of note: in slaying and dismembering the denizens of the dungeon, you may find yourself learning useful information that will help you greatly in future encounters with the same creatures.

### Gathering Ingredients
If it is known that edible plants exist in an area, players may roll a WIS(survival) check in order to gather ingredients. If the flora is unrecognised, players may roll an INT(nature) check to try and collect safe ingredients. When gathering parts from monsters, players may roll and INT(nature) check to figure out what is and isn’t useable.

### Cooking
There is no cooking skill in D&D 5e, so here are the homebrew rules. The cooking process is split into 3 stages: preparation, execution and presentation.

Preparation is based on your DEX modifier, as it involves deft dicing and slicing, as well as avoiding the less savoury or inedible parts.

Execution is based on your INT modifier, as it is based on knowing how to cook a particular dish.

Finally, presentation – this is based solely on player imagination, but is just as important as a die roll. Depending on how a dish is presented, it may have effects on appetite and morale which will translate into real consequences.
It is not normal to eat monsters after all (imagine eating toad or scorpion in real life… I have eaten both but the point stands…) and your characters may find the concept hard to, erm, swallow.

### Crafting
Ingredients are not the only thing you can gather from slain monsters. From skin to bone, many monster parts can be used to create basic items, either for use or trade. Mechanics will be discussed on a case-by-case basis – for instance, crafting leather to make boots will require leatherworker’s tools, skill checks, and time. Certain parts and various herbs can also be used for medicinal purposes, and miscellaneous items like a poison sac could find use in battle.

## The World
A series of worldbuilding questions, answered.

### How is the Peace Maintained?
Initially, different races developed in different lands. Over time, civilisations began to interact and trade - humans in particular colonised all over the continent, catalysing the mixing of cultures.

In these modern times, countries are still partially headed by their original peoples, but there is an overarching world government formed of representatives from all over the globe, and headed by the elves. Most countries follow some kind of pyramidal system where the land is divided into counties ruled by councils, with each city or township within having a governor (elected or otherwise).

### How has Magic Influenced this Setting?
Magic is a force that infuses and nourishes this world. Its inhabitants can be highly magical to the point of needing magic like needing oxygen, while others barely interact with it.

All people have the ability to use magic, as all creatures have within them a source of magic. Many natually magical creatures also exist - it is as much a force of nature that shapes their evolution as the climate is. The greatest natural source of magic on the planet is dungeons. These self-sustaining ecosystems are a crucial element of the world, and great care must be taken to conserve them.

Note that these natural dungeons are different from the megadungeons that have been discovered at various points in time throughout the land - these have clear influence from civilisation, though their origins remain a mystery to most.

The elves are a race that have a deep affinity for magic - they are able to channel its power to great effect and do not suffer the side effects (mana-sickness) as quickly as other races. As such, their knowledge of magic is more advanced than most, and they have appointed themselves as wardens over magic itself. They see it as their duty to protect people from magic... and vice versa.

### How has Technology Influenced this Setting?
### How is Religion Handled?
There are a myriad of pantheons that are worshipped throughout the world. The world government has no official stance on religion, so there is no default. Some civilisations are more autocratic in nature than others, and these might hold more stringent control over the population's belief systems.

Religion and magic are interlinked only through cultural means - for instance, followers of a nature god may naturally focus on magic that relates to this domain.

## The Party
You are a group of adventurers who recently returned, under unfortunate circumstances, from an expedition into the dungeon. Though you had been well prepared and are by no means inexperienced, you had also fallen to misfortune, losing valuable time and supplies. Hungry and fatigued, you then stumbled into an encounter with a red dragon.
With a TPK imminent, your cleric, Radost, teleported you back to the dungeon entrance in a last ditch effort to save the party. However, she herself was caught in the jaws of the dragon, and did not materialise with the rest of you.

You are currently recovering at an inn back at Base, having lost most of your gold and supplies. Two of your party members have since left, perhaps understandably. Those of you who remain have decided to return to the depths on a mission to retrieve Radost, along with enough treasure to pay for her resurrection. With no money or rations, your only option will be to survive off the flora and fauna that populates the dungeon.

### The Players
You must decide amongst yourselves how your characters are related. For instance, you may have a connection with Radost strong enough to warrant a suicide mission to bring her back; or a strong connection with another party member who feels this way. Perhaps you simply wish to return to the site of the battle to gather your lost belongings and loot. Perhaps this group happens to amuse you and you wish to stay with them for entertainment. Whatever the case, you must find a good reason for returning to the dungeon despite your weakened state.

You are starting this campaign at level 3. However, you only have your first level equipment, minus any gold or rations. You may sell items (at half their original price) and buy other things using this money.
