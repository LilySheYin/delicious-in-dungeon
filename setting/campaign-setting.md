# Dungeon Meshi
A wholesome homebrewed campaign setting based on the manga by Ryōko Kui.
Explore the myth and mystery of the phenomenon we know as dungeons, unravel the mechanics of magic, and forge bonds that can only exist between people who have seen hell and used the flames to cook a meal together.

## About the Game
Dungeon Meshi is based on a manga, and translates to “Delicious in Dungeon”… DinD.

Often ignored or treated as a chore in most campaigns, food will instead be a core mechanic in this game. Depending on how successful you are at in-game meal prep, food will not only stave off the effects of Exhaustion, but can even heal or buff (or debuff, depending on circumstances…) your characters.

Also of note: in slaying and dismembering the denizens of the dungeon, you may find yourself learning useful information that will help you greatly in future encounters with the same creatures.

### Gathering Ingredients
If it is known that edible plants exist in an area, players may roll a WIS(survival) check in order to gather ingredients. If the flora is unrecognised, players may roll an INT(nature) check to try and collect safe ingredients. When gathering parts from monsters, players may roll and INT(nature) check to figure out what is and isn’t useable.

### Cooking
There is no cooking skill in D&D 5e, so here are the homebrew rules. The cooking process is split into 3 stages: preparation, execution and presentation.

Preparation is based on your DEX modifier, as it involves deft dicing and slicing, as well as avoiding the less savoury or inedible parts.

Execution is based on your INT modifier, as it is based on knowing how to cook a particular dish.

Finally, presentation – this is based solely on player imagination, but is just as important as a die roll. Depending on how a dish is presented, it may have effects on appetite and morale which will translate into real consequences.
It is not normal to eat monsters after all (imagine eating toad or scorpion in real life… I have eaten both but the point stands…) and your characters may find the concept hard to, erm, swallow.

### Crafting
Ingredients are not the only thing you can gather from slain monsters. From skin to bone, many monster parts can be used to create basic items, either for use or trade. Mechanics will be discussed on a case-by-case basis – for instance, crafting leather to make boots will require leatherworker’s tools, skill checks, and time. Certain parts and various herbs can also be used for medicinal purposes, and miscellaneous items like a poison sac could find use in battle.

## The World
A series of worldbuilding questions, answered.

### How is the Peace Maintained?
Initially, different races developed in different lands. Over time, civilisations began to interact and trade - humans in particular colonised all over the continent, catalysing the mixing of cultures.

In these modern times, countries are still partially headed by their original peoples, but there is an overarching world government formed of representatives from all over the globe, and headed by the elves. Most countries follow some kind of pyramidal system where the land is divided into counties ruled by councils, with each city or township within having a governor (elected or otherwise).

A recent addition to the world council is that of the Tritons. Wardens of the seas, they have only relatively recently emerged from the depths to interact with the world above. Their secretive society has a scholar exchange program in place between various nations, and they have formed particularly close ties to the elves, whose culture most closely resembles theirs.

### How has Magic Influenced this Setting?
Magic is a force that infuses and nourishes this world. Its inhabitants can be highly magical to the point of needing magic like needing oxygen, while others barely interact with it.

All people have the ability to use magic, as all creatures have within them a source of magic. Many natually magical creatures also exist - it is as much a force of nature that shapes their evolution as the climate is. This alternative souce of power allows the existence of physically improbable beings.

The greatest natural source of magic on the planet is dungeons. These self-sustaining ecosystems are a crucial element of the world, and great care must be taken to conserve them. Note that these natural dungeons are different from the megadungeons that have been discovered throughout the land - these have clear influence from civilisation, though their origins remain a mystery to most. Scholars believe they were created by ancient peoples, lost to time.

The elves are a race that have a deep affinity for magic - they are able to channel its power to great effect and do not suffer the side effects (mana-sickness) as quickly as other races. As such, their knowledge of magic is more advanced than most, and they have appointed themselves as wardens over magic itself. They see it as their duty to protect people from magic... and vice versa.

### How has Technology Influenced this Setting?
Technology influences the world in similar ways as in our own history. An argument can be made that the development of technologies has stagnated to some degree due to the influence of magic. Yet, some civilisations have found ways to advance technology through magic itself. In this modern era, dwarves and gnomes have been able to harness magic to power more complex machinery than ever before. This has put them at odds with the elves, who consider magic a resource that should be managed with care.

### How is Religion Handled?
There are a myriad of pantheons worshipped throughout the world. The central government has no official stance on religion, so there is no default. Some civilisations are more autocratic in nature than others, and these might hold more stringent control over the population's belief systems.

Religion and magic are interlinked only through cultural means - for instance, followers of a nature god may naturally focus on magic that relates to this domain, in the same way that monks of different monasteries develop differing ways of training their bodies.

### How are Monsters so Prevalent?
"Monsters" are simply a part of nature, though more improbable and dangerous creatures tend to spawn in and near higher concentrations of magic.

### Who are Important Figures in Current History?
The current president of the world council, Archmage Canevera ("archmage" being a title like "Dr"), holds a great deal of power. They oversee a council of high ranking representatives of various nations.

A particularly important sector of the world council is the Department of Mana Management. They control a military group known colloqially as the Canaries - a group of soldiers whose purpose is to monitor the development of megadungeons and seal or destroy them if they perceive them to be enough of a threat. This is not a popular practice because the presence of a megadungeon is a huge boost to the local economy.

The Island, the small and out-of-the-way nation on which the titular dungeon is found, is ruled over by a human, Governor Iver.


### What are important events in Prior History?
Fifteen or so years ago, a known megadungeon crumbled and the nearby village of Utaya was destroyed in the following chaos. There were significant casualties in the village, including elven soldiers who came in to help, with the fallen turning into monsters themselves and eating the living. The elves have taken measures to prevent such an event from occurring again, by exacting a greater measure of control over megadungeons wherever they are found.

## Known Races
### Dragonborn
Dragonborn are a reptilian race found mostly in the southern half of the continent. They prefer warmer weather. Their numbers are relatively few, and they are long-lived (up to 160 years). Honour is an important concept to the dragonborn, and they have a rigid social structure. The clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else. Each dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.

### Dwarves
Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs — these common threads unite all dwarves. Dwarven culture is quite technologically advanced. They have led great advances in science and are advocates of harnessing the power of magic to fuel machinery and automation. They do not hold a powerful organised military as such, preferring to put their resources into discovery and learning, but as a society they place great importance in the individual ability to wield a weapon.

### Elves
Elves love nature and magic, art and music, and the beautiful things of the world. They prefer trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence - still, their natural magical affinity makes them a force to be reckoned with. Their longevity (up to 250 years) led them to treat many of the shorter-lived races like children who needed a higher power to guide them. These days this way of thinking has faded, but has left some level of animosity and rebellion behind. Elves have a deep reverence for the natural world, and their way of life has as little impact on nature as they can manage. Many elves live a tribal lifestyle, and while they are numerous, there are only a handful of elven cities in the world.

### Gnomes
Gnomes are inventors and scholars by nature, taking delight in new knowledge and experiences. They can be found all over the continent. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They’re willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.

### Halflings
Often mistaken for human children, halflings are not to be underestimated. They have survived in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. However, they tend to be resourceful and smart, and will carve out a niche for themselves wherever they go. Community is important to halflings, and it is rare to find one travelling alone.

### Humans
Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.

### Kenku
Despite their lack of wings, kenku love dwelling in towers and other tall structures. They seek out ruins that reach to the sky, though they lack the motivation and creativity to make repairs or fortify such places. Even so, their light weight and size allow them to dwell in rickety structures that would collapse beneath a human or an orc.

Some thieves’ guilds use kenku as lookouts and messengers. The kenku dwell in the tallest buildings and towers the guild controls, allowing them to lurk in the highest levels and to keep watch on the city below.

### Kobolds
Furred humanoids with faces resembling that of canines, kobolds tend to live in small, roving communities. They value social structure, and desire to always be part of a group.

### Oni
Oni is an umbrella term for a physically intimidating and warlike people that include hobgoblins, goliaths and tieflings. War is an important pillar of oni culture. Its glories are the dreams that inspire them. Its horrors don’t feature in their nightmares. Cowardice is more terrible to oni than dying. Aside from this violent outlook, oni are known to enjoy feasting and drinking to a great extent.

### Orcs
A nomadic people more often at war with each other than with others, orcs have diminished greatly in number in recent years. Those who have survived thus far have learned to live a different kind of life - many orcs have integrated fully into various settlements. Other continue to lurk on the edges of civilisation where most do not dare to tread.

### Tabaxi
Most tabaxi remain in their distant homeland, content to dwell in small, tight clans. These tabaxi hunt for food, craft goods, and largely keep to themselves.

However, not all tabaxi are satisfied with such a life. The Cat Lord, the divine figure responsible for the creation of the tabaxi, gifts each of his children with one specific feline trait. Those tabaxi gifted with curiosity are compelled to wander far and wide. They seek out stories, artifacts, and lore. Those who survive this period of wanderlust return home in their elder years to share news of the outside world. In this manner, the tabaxi remain isolated but never ignorant of the world beyond their home.

### Tortles
Tortles are a small population who hail from beyond the western shores. They have colonised the numerous small islands that speckle the ocean there. What many tortles consider a simple life, others might call a life of adventure. Tortles are born near sandy coastlines, but as soon as they’re able to walk on two legs, they become nomad survivalists eager to explore the wilderness, experience its many wonders, put their skills to the test, and make new acquaintances.

### Tritons
Long-established guardians of the deep ocean floor, in recent years the tritons have become increasingly active in the world above. Little is known of them, and they are uncommonly seen above the waves. Those who do exist on land are often explorers or scholars, reporting back to the deep. Tritons care deeply for the natural world, and see themselves as its wardens.

## Locations
Notable locations on Kanterra.

### The Dungeon
A megadungeon discovered on The Island some five years ago. Its architecture seems to take influence from many cultures, but it is difficult to pin down the origin. Dungeons of this kind have always been of immense interest to archaeologists and historians.

As the riches of the upper levels were plundered, the delver population began to level out. It is currently seeing something of a resurgence however - and some experienced delvers have noted that the monsters that lurk in the depths seem to be getting more dangerous nowadays.

### The Island
An island located south of the main continent. It was a mostly coastal economy until the discovery of the Dungeon, which has led to a population surge and the growth of the adventuring industry. Now the village flourishes as a delver town, attracting scholars, mages and mercenaries alike. Guilds formed, professional resurrectionists
set up shop, and tourism boomed. Many academy students from the mainland choose to begin their professional careers here, knowing that the risk can be well worth the reward.

### The Mainland
A large continent that makes up the vast majority of landmass on Kanterra. Comprised of multiple countries under the control of various governments, most notably that of elves, dwarves, and humans.

### Tian Xia
The eastern archipelagos. In a state of near-constant civil war, its inhabitants include humans, kobolds, oni and tabaxi.

## The Party
You are a group of adventurers who recently returned, under unfortunate circumstances, from an expedition into the dungeon. Though you had been well prepared and are by no means inexperienced, you had also fallen to misfortune, losing valuable time and supplies. Hungry and fatigued, you then stumbled into an encounter with a red dragon.
With a TPK imminent, your cleric, Radost, teleported you back to the dungeon entrance in a last ditch effort to save the party. However, she herself was caught in the jaws of the dragon, and did not materialise with the rest of you.

You are currently recovering at an inn back at Base, having lost most of your gold and supplies. Two of your party members have since left, perhaps understandably. Those of you who remain have decided to return to the depths on a mission to retrieve Radost, along with enough treasure to pay for her resurrection. With no money or rations, your only option will be to survive off the flora and fauna that populates the dungeon.

You are all suffering from the effects of magical decompression, and it will take much time and rest to regain the full extent of your powers - time you do not necessarily have.

### The Players
You must decide amongst yourselves how your characters are related. For instance, you may have a connection with Radost strong enough to warrant a suicide mission to bring her back; or a strong connection with another party member who feels this way. Perhaps you simply wish to return to the site of the battle to gather your lost belongings and loot. Perhaps this group happens to amuse you and you wish to stay with them for entertainment. Whatever the case, you must find a good reason for returning to the dungeon despite your weakened state.

You are starting this campaign at level 3. However, you only have your first level equipment, minus any gold or rations. You may sell items (at half their original price) and buy other things using this money.
